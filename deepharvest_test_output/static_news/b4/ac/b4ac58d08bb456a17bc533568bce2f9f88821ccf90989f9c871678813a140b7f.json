Now, she has an AI-powered arm. See more How AI helped my back pain (sort of...) Back pain is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, but an AI-powered app is being used to help patients in the UK to manage their symptoms. But how does it measure up? We gave an AI a Rorschach test. What did it see? Inkblot tests play with the human imagination and our mind's ability to impart meaning onto the world around us \u2013 but what does AI see in them?
