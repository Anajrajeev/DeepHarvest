Hard disagree.  I'm not going to argue that Java debugging was the best, however: 1. You could remote debug your code as it ran on the server. 2. You could debug code which wouldn't even compile, as long as your execution path stayed within the clean code. 3. You could then fix a bit more of the broken code and continue, and the debugger would backtrack and carry on. This is what I remember as someone who spent decades (since Java 1.0) working as a contract consultant, mainly on server side Java. Of course this will not convince anyone who is determined to remain skeptical, but I think those are compelling capabilities. huzaifah0x00 1 minute ago | parent | context |  on: PGlite \u2013 Embeddable Postgres This is interesting, I've been looking for something like this that I can use in unit/integration tests. I've used the mongodb memory server for testing but never found something like that for Postgres that didn't require running a full PG server instance... Definitely going to try this out for tests and see how it goes. bayindirh 1 minute ago | parent | context |  on: It\u2019s time to free JavaScript ...and we'll have another API warfa^H^H^H^H lawsuit that we had for Java. reddalo 1 minute ago | parent | context |  on: Programming peaked I think the web is not livable anymore without Firefox and uBlock Origin. ascagnel_ 1 minute ago | parent | context |  on: Unreal Tournament 2004 is back Not just working, but it actually ran better in Linux for me -- my university-mandated laptop could only run it at 1280x800 in Windows if you wanted to hit 60fps, but the Linux client was able to run at the panel's native 1920x1200. stephencanon 2 minutes ago | parent | context |  on: Schubfach: The smallest floating point double-to-s... Schubfach's table is quite large compared to some alternatives with similar performance characteristics. swiftDtoa's code and tables combined are smaller than just Schubfach's table in the linked implementation. Ryu and Dragonbox are larger than swiftDtoa, but also use smaller tables than Schubfach, IIRC. If I$ is all you care about, then table size may not matter, but for constrained systems, other algorithms in general, and swiftDtoa in particular, may be better choices.

Seems like just yesterday. It's also about when my daughter was born which also seems like yesterday. I was doing a whole lot of Netscape plug-in development around then. And traveled to Netscape's and Sun's offices in CA several times. Exciting era it was. estimator7292 2 minutes ago | parent | context |  on: Australia says world will follow social media ban ... Look at mastodon. Absolutely nobody and nothing influences what you see except you. The only things you see are posts from people you follow, in chronological order.

The obvious question would be how does it compare to dedicated vector databases (qdrant, pinecone, chroma, etc..). What are the tradeoffs? nutjob2 2 minutes ago | parent | context |  on: Everyone in Seattle hates AI You whole comment reads like someone who is a victim of hype. LLMs are great in their own way, but they're not a panacea. You may recall that magic is way to trick people into believing things that are not true. The mythical form of magic doesn't exist. sd9 3 minutes ago | parent | context |  on: I ignore the spotlight as a staff engineer What do you mean? The quoted text is the strategy I always use. I don't want or need to be told top down what to do, it's better to think for myself and propose that upward. Execs appreciate it because it makes their job easier; users get the features they actually want.

It is fine if a dependency hasn't been updated in years, if the number of dependent projects hasn't gone down. Especially if no issues are getting created. Particularly with cargo or npm type package managers where a dependency may do one small thing that never needs to change. Time since last update can be a good thing, it doesn't always mean abandoned. sam-cop-vimes 3 minutes ago | parent | context |  on: Porn company fined \u00a31M over inadequate age checks ... My kids are millenials. They are fine too, but that is only because my wife and I worked really hard to regulate their access. We caught our 7 year old son searching for some offensive stuff on the internet and when asked, his answer was \"my friends are looking for it\". In his teen years, we started hearing some stuff you'd typically associate with the toxic manosphere. A number of discussions later it turned out he was picking this off the internet. Parents who talk about the difficulty of dealing with all this are labelled as hysterical, emotional, helicopter parents...the list goes on. My only response to that is what I tell most people - don't judge parents too harshly until you've had the opportunity to be one. lionkor 3 minutes ago | parent | context |  on: Show HN: Fresh \u2013 A new terminal editor built in Ru... > statically linked I'm not sure where you got this idea.
