The Python Software Foundation acts as a fiscal sponsor for a much smaller set of orgs (20 listed on https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/ ) and it keeps our accounting team pretty busy just looking after those. Hack Club must have this down to a very fine art.

Made some great friends, though! It's a really fantastic organization. The students have one big global Slack instance.

But why?.... reply coldtea 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] That's not jaded, that's paranoid-ly misreading this. It's an organization for hacking working with high schools and young people. They don't want small children enrolled, and they don't want older people. \"teenager 18 and under\" is perfectly fine description for 13-18 or 7th to 12th grade. reply DiggyJohnson 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] You already made the point but yea that\u2019s overly jaded to a significant degree reply squigz 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Yeah, I get suspicious when schools say only minors can enroll there reply dannyobrien 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] We interviewed their founder Zach Latta on the EFF podcast[1] a few years back: I hadn't heard of them either, but he was pretty impressive, both on the goals and the political issues.

That kind of behaviour indicates a service that shouldn't be relied on so much, at least not without low-friction alternates that you keep ready to jump onto, in case some exec there decides again that the Club is too tempting a prize to not attempt another squeeze. reply CactusBlue 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] MMW: this will likely end up being the SVB for nonprofits reply toomuchtodo 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] They're using Column ( https://column.com/ ) under the hood, so more like Stripe (payments + Atlas) for non profits I think?

They forgot to handle images properly, so they\u2019re serving ginormous images in inefficient formats instead of scaled thumbnails in efficient formats\u2014just the first page transfers more than 40MB, and the second page is just as bad, and the third significantly worse. You get things like 11827\u00d713107 \u201c17230 Aluminium Falcons\u201d logo being rendered at 64px high. (I\u2019m surprised that one\u2019s under 9MB.) Across pages 1\u20133, it\u2019s averaging 1MB per item, which if it continues all the way to page 53 would exceed 2.5GB. Done properly, I\u2019d expect most to be under 10KB, with a few up as high as 50KB, staying well under 1MB per page, and comfortably under 50MB for all 53 pages. It\u2019d load faster and be cheaper to serve too. (I know this isn\u2019t what you meant, but it loaded so slowly that I looked, and that\u2019s easily big enough to cause problems for some users.) reply conradev 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] and as with most things in Hack Club... it's open source :) https://github.com/hackclub/hcb/issues/12314 reply Barbing 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Just let them know  (admittedly not through a previously known reliable channel FYI, I\u2019m a stranger) reply garyhtou 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] I love seeing PSF support the community with fiscal sponsorship! It makes such a huge difference for these open source projects and meetups, letting them focus on software and community rather than the legal/financial back-office work. Hack Club's been a fiscal sponsor for about 7 years now (since 2018), and it's evolved quite a bit since the early days. I run engineering & product for the fiscal sponsorship program there and would be happy to chat/share any tips! oh, and while it's on my mind, the codebase was open-sourced earlier this year ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43519802 ), and we just launched a mobile app yesterday! https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46130402 reply throwaway290 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Hack Club was featured on front page not long ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45913663 It might have improved since then? reply arjie 16 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013] Mitchell Hashimoto is a real programmer in the old vein. It's lovely to see him succeed. Ghostty is fantastic to use. There was a devtools blackhole era once where if you got in that business you were just giving things away and never got to reap the rewards. Then there was this era of founders who figured out how to make it sticky and capture value in a Pareto-optimal way.

Both of my companies are named after myself, one directly so and the other being a portmanteau of my business partner's and my names. It had very little to do with self aggrandizing and more to do with the tax authorities need a name and time was limited. The names were used mostly as placeholders and then stuck.

This coming from someone who spends 90% of the workday in the terminal. Asking in good faith -- could someone tell me what's special about Ghostty compared to alternatives? reply novella_rel 2 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013] To me it has a couple advantages over the other options on the market. 1. Feels 'native' and is built for each platform. This means I can use for example familiar right click context menu's and tabs that I find on every other app. I have the option to use the mouse as well as the keyboard which I appreciate. 2. It has sensible defaults with a \"Zero Configuration Philosophy\" meaning that many of the things I would usually need to fiddle with are already set. 3. It performs comparably to advanced terminal emulators such as kitty. The combination of all three (and especially the first) is why I use it. reply Vinnl 42 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] What's an example of a thing you usually need to fiddle with? I feel like 1 and 3 are already true for my existing native terminal emulators, which I also never configure. So presumably there are things Ghostty does that aren't enabled by default on my other ones that I could take advantage of? reply throwaway2037 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Here is the full about page it: https://ghostty.org/docs/about Zero trolling when I say this: Two things also make it (more) popular on HN: (1) Mitchell Hashimoto (a well respected hacker who got rich, then kept on hacking) and (2) Zig.  (Only Rust could attract more attention.) reply tiborsaas 13 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] I used iTerm2 a lot, configured it to my liking, but then I tried Ghostty for curiosity and for some reason I sticked to it. I think it's just cleaner and leaner and the default looks pretty cool and minimalistic, I don't really miss anything from iTerm. Yes, it's just another terminal emulator, but a pretty solid one that just works. reply kombine 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] I've been using Kitty terminal and they are absolutely comparable in the feature set: GPU-based rendering, speed, customisation. OS-native controls in Ghostty are not very important to me, I like terminal being a terminal, not a GUI. reply theasisa 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] I've been using Tabby on MacOS but Kitty looks neat, I'll give it a go. Thanks for mentioning it! reply jwr 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] It's just better in every way than anything else I have ever tried (at least on a Mac). The author cares and it shows.

Starts quickly, doesn't get bogged down when dumping large amounts of text into it, got some nice themes. I find it a bit messy to build but I'm not exactly a compile binaries kind of person anymore so it's probably a good sign that I still manage to figure it out. If stuff like Zig is your thing you'll probably enjoy this part. My main terminal emulator is the bog slow but reliable Terminator, though in a while I'll probably flip the i3 commands and move over entirely to Ghostty. reply cbolton 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] Ghostty is quite slow to start on my Linux machine, very close the the first start of GNOME Terminal (or Terminator).

So thanks, IBM! <3 reply veverkap 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] While you're not wrong, I think this undersells a little how much Mitchell has given of his time to OSS. Yes, he's fortunate that he doesn't have to worry about money, but even when he did, he still contributed openly and freely. That's part of what drew lots of us to HashiCorp in the first place - giving back. reply mindcrash 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] It's a little tongue-in-cheek, but as you can see elsewhere in this discussion thread he mentions this himself on his own X account: \"get asked the same about terminals all the time. \u201cHow will you turn this into a business?

Sounds like the literal dream reply charcircuit 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] There are a ton of different projects one can devote free work to. Eventually one will get bored and want to change things up. reply KPGv2 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Without turning this into a brag session, this is my experience. I don't have to worry about money anymore, so I get to work on cool projects at my own pace, do things that probably sound pointless to most, and it doesn't matter if it's successful. The important thing is that I'm interested. I'm not as talented as Mitchell tho. reply bdcravens 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Money begets the freedom to work on causes. Monetization was always a core part of Hashicorp, rather than being a bolt-on after years of OSS. Which is a good thing.

The companies that hire us usually make us sign promises that we won't work on side projects. Even if there are legal workarounds to that, it's not quite so simple. Even still, whatever high salaries they do give us just flow right back into the neighborhoods through insane property values and other cost-of-living expenses that negate any gains. So, it\u2019s always just the few of us who can win that lottery and truly break out of the cycle. reply yalok 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] moonlighting is permitted by law in California (companies legally can't prevent you from doing it, iiuc), as long as there's no conflict of interest with your main job... reply jarjoura 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] \"no conflict of interest\" is basically meaningless if your day job is writing software. These clauses you sign are quite broad in what that scope of conflict could be. Every company I've worked for has had very explicit rules that say, you must get written permission from someone at some director or VP level sign off on your \"side project,\" open source or not. You might want to check your company guidelines around this just to make sure you're safe. reply kyrra 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] Side projects that aren't a conflict of interest when working at Google is rather limiting.  Likely less so for small companies. reply yalok 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] Not really, in my personal experience and per my friends, most of big companies are pretty lenient about it, except for Apple. reply fragmede 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] As long as you don't use their hardware to do it. reply jarjoura 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] that goes without saying, but it's still not free permission when you use your own stuff. reply KPGv2 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] > whatever high salaries they do give us just flow right back into the neighborhoods through insane property values and other cost-of-living expenses that negate any gains. So, it\u2019s always just the few of us who can win that lottery and truly break out of the cycle. You break out of the cycle by selling your HCOL home and moving to LCOL after a few years. That HCOL home will have appreciated fast enough given the original purchase price that the growth alone would easily pay for a comparable home in a LCOL area. This is the story of my village in Texas, where Cali people have been buying literal mansions after moving out of their shitboxes in LA and the Bay Area. reply zikduruqe 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Good.

OpenAI was a non-profit foundation that held a controlling share in a for-profit organisation. It's model is based around controlling access to their data (which was never open), and controlling access to their models (which are also not open). If Ghostty does sets up a for-profit org with the NFP as the majority holder then we can have the conversation, but even at that fork + move on (like OpenTofu, Valkey, CentOS, MariaDB, Jenkins) is an option. reply purpleidea 17 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013] This is great work and good news, however if you want to guarantee a long-term public benefit, use copyleft without a CLA!

Also things like filesystems.  More generally, the history of BSD is full of proprietary forks that never got merged back in: Ultrix, SunOS, BSDI's BSD/386 (later BSD/OS), Winsock, and the Wollongong TCP/IP stack on UNICOS and, I think, also on VMS.  The most famous fork is macOS Darwin, which I think is still in fact open source, but it's been many years since I saw someone successfully running the open-source Darwin. Also, though, GCC got Objective-C support, and still has it, because the FSF told NeXT it would violate the GPL for them to attempt to make Objective-C a proprietary add-on to the GCC compiler, even if it wasn't literally linked with it.

Most of the recent variations of this that come to my mind are related to cloud infrastructure. Stuff where you have serious business customers. And in some of those cases GPL wasn't enough to prevent it. Niche end user utilities, where original is available for free have little room for monetization. And in many cases existing users are already choosing the open source option despite the existence of commercial solutions, or where it's too niche for commercial solutions to exist. Only thing that comes to my mind is VScode with all the AI craze. But that doesn't quite fit the pattern neither is the Microsoft underdog, nor it's clear that any of AI based editors derived from VScode will survive by themselves long term.

Well, since we're talking about it, maybe you're down to answer a question I've always wondered about: money into the hundred millions, let alone billions, is for me an unfathomable amount of capital for one person to wield. I've always thought, if I ever had that kind of power to swing around, I'd spend it all trying to solve every problem I could get my hands on, until there was nothing left but my retirement fund (which could be 10 million and still let me spend hundreds of millions while retiring in permanent wealthy comfort). Hunger in specific areas, housing crises, underfunded education, across the world many issues that, at least locally, one individual with that kind of money could, so far as I can tell, independently resolve. Why aren't the ultra rich doing it? You seem to have a more philanthropic mind than most, you're doing this cool project and nobody can deny your FOSS contributions. But even you are still holding onto keeping that count into the hundreds rather than the tens - is there some quality of life aspect hidden to us that's just really difficult to imagine giving up or something?

Wezterm is great but I found it noticeably slow in some (dumb) instances -- eg 144fps rendering of games, input latency and had issues on wayland at some point. Dunno if that makes Ghostty \"better\" than other terminals, probably not. It just ticks the boxes of ligatures, fast, integration with wayland, simple amount of configuration to work how I want. It also seemed to have a focus on \"correctness\" which I appreciate. I don't use any of the tab/ssh/whatever features. I know ligatures are the new vi-vs-emacs religious war. Without that single feature-request, I'd probably just use foot. Swapping terminal also isn't that hard, it'd easily swap to something else if it gave me a reason. I do think its reasonable to question focus on a millionaires toy with a large social presence vs other projects, helped by the somewhat --if not intentional , at least side-effecting -- hype-focused release style of Ghostty. Would it be nearly as successful if it were released anonymously at a 1.0? Probably not? Maybe? It does score highly in sort of arbitrary feature & performance benchmarks so it would probably still have a number of users without the name attached. reply spott 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Libghostty is a pretty huge contribution. reply alwillis 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] > All of the fuss seems to be entirely driven by Mitchell's clout, and maybe some interest in Zig. Nope, that's not it. It's mostly because he noticed the majority of terminal applications were okay but not great. So he decides to address this by creating a cross-platform terminal app that's faster and more compatible than pretty much every existing terminal app. And has a native macOS UI written in Swift without compromising its cross-platform features. Kind of out of nowhere, Ghostty is in the conversation of being the best terminal app available. \"Best\" doesn't mean the most features; but it nails speed and compatibility. (I\u2019d love to see iTerm switch to using libghostty in the near future. That would be a killer combination!) From \"State of Terminal Emulators in 2025: The Errant Champions\": [1] Before presenting the latest results, Ghostty warrants particular attention, not only because it scored the highest among all terminals tested, but that it was publicly released only this year by Mitchell Hashimoto. It is a significant advancement. Developed from scratch in Zig, the Unicode support implementation is thoroughly correct In 2023, Mitchell published Grapheme Clusters and Terminal Emulators, demonstrating a commitment to understanding and implementing the fundamentals. His recent announcement of libghostty provides a welcome alternative to libvte, potentially enabling a new generation of terminals on a foundation of strong Unicode support.

One of my pet peeves is people trotting out \u201cI believe\u201d statements. (Usually) I care much more about the evidence that backs the belief than the belief. Putting aside my cantankerousness, I am glad Michael believes in setting up good incentives for the organization that will manage Ghostty. (But being glad right now doesn\u2019t count for much.) At a deeper level, my more\nprecise complaint is people broadcasting \u201cI believe\u201d statements as if doing so should persuade us. It should not. \u201cI believe\u201d statements may often be personal and genuine, but they are so easily abused that perhaps they should be enumerated among the dark patterns of rhetoric. (There are some ridiculous quote from the first episode of Silicon Valley by Mike Judge that pokes fun at the zealotry behind belief, but I can\u2019t quote it off the top of my head.) In the case of software projects with broad benefits that want continuity over a long period of time, I want to agree that the not-for-profit structure is a good choice and often than the alternatives. But I don\u2019t know that this has been carefully studied. My hunch would be there are stronger causal predictors such as governance mechanisms. Choosing an organization form is just step one. Smart governance, and long-term execution can only be shown with time. Individuals with unaligned incentives will challenge any organization\u2019s set of rules. In the same way that our immune system has to evolve over time to win, organizational rules at all levels have to evolve.

It has sensible defaults with a \"Zero Configuration Philosophy\" meaning that many of the things I would usually need to fiddle with are already set. 3.

I suspect that those who express concern over your work being ripped off are just showing that they are extremely happy with how you run things.

Also things like filesystems. More generally, the history of BSD is full of proprietary forks that never got merged back in: Ultrix, SunOS, BSDI's BSD/386 (later BSD/OS), Winsock, and the Wollongong TCP/IP stack on UNICOS and, I think, also on VMS. The most famous fork is macOS Darwin, which I think is still in fact open source, but it's been many years since I saw someone successfully running the open-source Darwin. Also, though, GCC got Objective-C support, and still has it, because the FSF told NeXT it would violate the GPL for them to attempt to make Objective-C a proprietary add-on to the GCC compiler, even if it wasn't literally linked with it.

Most of the recent variations of this that come to my mind are related to cloud infrastructure. Stuff where you have serious business customers. And in some of those cases GPL wasn't enough to prevent it. Niche end user utilities, where original is available for free have little room for monetization. And in many cases existing users are already choosing the open source option despite the existence of commercial solutions, or where it's too niche for commercial solutions to exist. Only thing that comes to my mind is VScode with all the AI craze. But that doesn't quite fit the pattern neither is the Microsoft underdog, nor it's clear that any of AI based editors derived from VScode will survive by themselves long term.

Well, since we're talking about it, maybe you're down to answer a question I've always wondered about: money into the hundred millions, let alone billions, is for me an unfathomable amount of capital for one person to wield. I've always thought, if I ever had that kind of power to swing around, I'd spend it all trying to solve every problem I could get my hands on, until there was nothing left but my retirement fund (which could be 10 million and still let me spend hundreds of millions while retiring in permanent wealthy comfort). Hunger in specific areas, housing crises, underfunded education, across the world many issues that, at least locally, one individual with that kind of money could, so far as I can tell, independently resolve. Why aren't the ultra rich doing it? You seem to have a more philanthropic mind than most, you're doing this cool project and nobody can deny your FOSS contributions. But even you are still holding onto keeping that count into the hundreds rather than the tens - is there some quality of life aspect hidden to us that's just really difficult to imagine giving up or something?

All of the fuss seems to be entirely driven by Mitchell's clout, and maybe some interest in Zig. Given that's the real reason everyone is talking about Ghostty (which I'm happy to be wrong about, let me know), It raises the question: Is crowding out other projects in a space, so that a billionaire can have a side project, really something we should be excited about?

Wezterm is great but I found it noticeably slow in some (dumb) instances -- eg 144fps rendering of games, input latency and had issues on wayland at some point. Dunno if that makes Ghostty \"better\" than other terminals, probably not. It just ticks the boxes of ligatures, fast, integration with wayland, simple amount of configuration to work how I want. It also seemed to have a focus on \"correctness\" which I appreciate. I don't use any of the tab/ssh/whatever features. I know ligatures are the new vi-vs-emacs religious war. Without that single feature-request, I'd probably just use foot. Swapping terminal also isn't that hard, it'd easily swap to something else if it gave me a reason. I do think its reasonable to question focus on a millionaires toy with a large social presence vs other projects, helped by the somewhat --if not intentional , at least side-effecting -- hype-focused release style of Ghostty. Would it be nearly as successful if it were released anonymously at a 1.0? Probably not? Maybe? It does score highly in sort of arbitrary feature & performance benchmarks so it would probably still have a number of users without the name attached. reply spott 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Libghostty is a pretty huge contribution. reply alwillis 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] > All of the fuss seems to be entirely driven by Mitchell's clout, and maybe some interest in Zig. Nope, that's not it. It's mostly because he noticed the majority of terminal applications were okay but not great. So he decides to address this by creating a cross-platform terminal app that's faster and more compatible than pretty much every existing terminal app. And has a native macOS UI written in Swift without compromising its cross-platform features. Kind of out of nowhere, Ghostty is in the conversation of being the best terminal app available. \"Best\" doesn't mean the most features; but it nails speed and compatibility. (I\u2019d love to see iTerm switch to using libghostty in the near future. That would be a killer combination!) From \"State of Terminal Emulators in 2025: The Errant Champions\": [1] Before presenting the latest results, Ghostty warrants particular attention, not only because it scored the highest among all terminals tested, but that it was publicly released only this year by Mitchell Hashimoto. It is a significant advancement. Developed from scratch in Zig, the Unicode support implementation is thoroughly correct In 2023, Mitchell published Grapheme Clusters and Terminal Emulators, demonstrating a commitment to understanding and implementing the fundamentals. His recent announcement of libghostty provides a welcome alternative to libvte, potentially enabling a new generation of terminals on a foundation of strong Unicode support.

Wezterm fits the vim/emacs bill of \u201cmake it whatever you want\u201d. I want something in between - iTerm2 for 2025. Stuff like secure input on macOS is something that is just nice - it behaves like a real platform app and not jsut the lowest common denominator loosely ported. They say in the docs it\u2019s not the best at anything, but it\u2019s competitive in performance, features, and extensibility and that combo is a winner for me (personally) reply dmytrokow 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] > Alacritty is \u201cbarebones\u201d and doesn\u2019t have modern features like... tabs.

If it's true that Alacritty and Ghostty are both great, Alacritty must be some different kind of great because it has a large number of users due only to its own merits, and not due to the online following of the author. reply ubercow13 44 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] Your whole comment is predicated on the idea that the software isn't actually good.

Covering costs (whether that's the expense of hosting / running the project or hiring talented people to work on it) is going to be a better incentive to keep the projects alive in the long term, meaning that people can rely on them instead of being wary that the project might become abandonware in a year. reply skywhopper 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Ever heard of the Free Software Foundation?

(Though Ghostty is ofc very unlikely to pull shenanigans) reply xpe 16 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013] > I believe infrastructure of this kind should be stewarded by a mission-driven, non-commercial entity that prioritizes public benefit over private profit. One of my pet peeves is people trotting out \u201cI believe\u201d statements. (Usually) I care much more about the evidence that backs the belief than the belief. Putting aside my cantankerousness, I am glad Michael believes in setting up good incentives for the organization that will manage Ghostty. (But being glad right now doesn\u2019t count for much.) At a deeper level, my more precise complaint is people broadcasting \u201cI believe\u201d statements as if doing so should persuade us. It should not. \u201cI believe\u201d statements may often be personal and genuine, but they are so easily abused that perhaps they should be enumerated among the dark patterns of rhetoric. (There are some ridiculous quote from the first episode of Silicon Valley by Mike Judge that pokes fun at the zealotry behind belief, but I can\u2019t quote it off the top of my head.) In the case of software projects with broad benefits that want continuity over a long period of time, I want to agree that the not-for-profit structure is a good choice and often than the alternatives. But I don\u2019t know that this has been carefully studied. My hunch would be there are stronger causal predictors such as governance mechanisms. Choosing an organization form is just step one. Smart governance, and long-term execution can only be shown with time. Individuals with unaligned incentives will challenge any organization\u2019s set of rules. In the same way that our immune system has to evolve over time to win, organizational rules at all levels have to evolve. Also, I do think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for smarter legal structures after the machinations pulled by OpenAI. reply skywhopper 16 hours ago | parent | next [2 more] [flagged] xpe 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] I would ask that you more carefully and neutrally reread my comment.
