A multimedia weather forecast applet written in Java can be scripted by JavaScript to display appropriate images and sounds based on the current weather readings in a region. A server-side JavaScript script might pull data out of a relational database and format it in HTML on the fly. A page might contain JavaScript scripts that run on both the client and the server. On the server, the scripts might dynamically compose and format HTML content based on user preferences stored in a relational database, and on the client, the scripts would glue together an assortment of Java applets and HTML form elements into a live interactive user interface for specifying a net-wide search for information. > \"Programmers have been overwhelmingly enthusiastic about Java because it was designed from the ground up for the Internet. JavaScript is a natural fit, since it's also designed for the Internet and Unicode-based worldwide use,\" said Bill Joy, co-founder and vice president of research at Sun. \"JavaScript will be the most effective method to connect HTML-based content to Java applets.\" This was all actually implemented. JavaScript functions could call Java applet methods and vice versa (see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/deplo... ). Of course over time everyone abandoned applets because of all the security problems, and JavaScript became a good enough language to write application logic directly in it. Still, there's more meaning behind the name than it just being a cynical marketing move. reply mikepurvis 11 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] The language now called Groovy would have been JavaScript if the name wasn\u2019t already taken. reply cubefox 12 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] > Of course over time everyone abandoned applets because of all the security problems, Haha, or because it froze the whole browser for a few seconds upon loading.

There are some the horrible, horrible things here and the laws need updating, as opposed to us simply saying this is for a judge to decide and there is nothing else we can do. I am ok with ditching the JavaScript name. I understand this cuts the problem entirely. However, there are other problems we have that we can't bypass so easily. We need copyright terms to be much reduced. We need CFAA fully repealed and not replaced by anything. We need to abolish software patents. There is a lot we need to do that will likely take a century to accomplish and that's likely being too optimistic. What we can't do is leave everything up to the judges because clearly even if we get a favorable ruling today, the precedent can be removed by another stroke of a pen. reply embedding-shape 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] > I think we are getting a rude awakening about what is legal versus what is actually right are not always the same thing. I'm not sure who \"we\" are here (Americans perhaps?), but humanity as a whole have known this for a long time, and acted accordingly. This is why presidents in some countries have the right to pardon people, as just one very evident example. That the USA exists as a country today is another example, which at the time when they were trying to create it, was clearly illegal, but since winners write history, still a \"good\" action. The the laws aren't 100% unambiguous and strict is also another example, so there is room for interpretation, as something can be \"by the book legal\" but because of the clear evil motivations and \"ignoring the spirit of the law\", still be illegal. Of course, highly dependent on the country and lots of counter-examples. reply rs186 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Who are \"people\"? How would all of this start? In terms of standard, the specs already use \"ECMAScript\" and don't even mention JavaScript ( https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/ ), although TC39 website does use it frequently. I guess they could officially recommend people stop using \"JavaScript\", but I doubt they care. Otherwise, the petitioner Deno here is only a small part of the ecosystem and barely controls anything (and really nobody other than TC39 controls anything, which is good). They (or anyone else) can't just shout \"stop saying JavaScript!\" and expect people to follow. Not to mention JavaScript is a simple, easy to pronounce word compared to ECMAScript despite the baggage, which is probably why they chose it in the first place. Let's say the \"JavaScript\" name is officially deprecated somehow. People will continue to use the name for as long as it exists. So Deno's petition tackles these problems, addresses the root cause and appears to be legally viable. That is the \"right thing to do\" here. Avoiding the name does not solve the problem. It never does. reply falcor84 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] But everyone already calls it JS.

It's a bad choice of name and always has been. It's caused way too much confusion over the years making people wrongly associate it with Java. My guess would be that associations exactly why Oracle doesn't want to give it up. I would like to say go back to the original name of LiveScript from before Netscape tried to woo Sun, but the name LiveScript has been co-opted. Something else with a J would probably be the least painful. JScript is permanently associated with Microsoft's terrible IE implementation. I offer up \"JaScript\" as it sounds largely like JavaScript but said with a drawl while retaining \"JS\". Heck, I'll call it RCMAScript if that's what it takes.

Having dealt with Oracle for over 20 years, I have seen their predatory relationship with their customers.  They will hold onto this trademark in the hope that they can somehow monetize it. At some point they will approach companies, likely tech companies that produce a product or offering that can't be described without using the word \"JavaScript\". They will offer a \"convenient\" licensing agreement of $50,000 per year for the use of their trademark. They used this playbook with Java, an easier path because they had something more substantial than a trademark, but the approach will be the same. https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/165kzxg/oraclejav...

A multimedia weather forecast applet written in Java can be scripted by JavaScript to display appropriate images and sounds based on the current weather readings in a region. A server-side JavaScript script might pull data out of a relational database and format it in HTML on the fly. A page might contain JavaScript scripts that run on both the client and the server. On the server, the scripts might dynamically compose and format HTML content based on user preferences stored in a relational database, and on the client, the scripts would glue together an assortment of Java applets and HTML form elements into a live interactive user interface for specifying a net-wide search for information. > \"Programmers have been overwhelmingly enthusiastic about Java because it was designed from the ground up for the Internet. JavaScript is a natural fit, since it's also designed for the Internet and Unicode-based worldwide use,\" said Bill Joy, co-founder and vice president of research at Sun. \"JavaScript will be the most effective method to connect HTML-based content to Java applets.\" This was all actually implemented. JavaScript functions could call Java applet methods and vice versa (see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/deplo... ). Of course over time everyone abandoned applets because of all the security problems, and JavaScript became a good enough language to write application logic directly in it. Still, there's more meaning behind the name than it just being a cynical marketing move. reply mikepurvis 11 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] The language now called Groovy would have been JavaScript if the name wasn\u2019t already taken. reply cubefox 12 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] > Of course over time everyone abandoned applets because of all the security problems, Haha, or because it froze the whole browser for a few seconds upon loading.

There are some the horrible, horrible things here and the laws need updating, as opposed to us simply saying this is for a judge to decide and there is nothing else we can do. I am ok with ditching the JavaScript name. I understand this cuts the problem entirely. However, there are other problems we have that we can't bypass so easily. We need copyright terms to be much reduced. We need CFAA fully repealed and not replaced by anything. We need to abolish software patents. There is a lot we need to do that will likely take a century to accomplish and that's likely being too optimistic.

I'm not sure who \"we\" are here (Americans perhaps?), but humanity as a whole have known this for a long time, and acted accordingly. This is why presidents in some countries have the right to pardon people, as just one very evident example. That the USA exists as a country today is another example, which at the time when they were trying to create it, was clearly illegal, but since winners write history, still a \"good\" action. The the laws aren't 100% unambiguous and strict is also another example, so there is room for interpretation, as something can be \"by the book legal\" but because of the clear evil motivations and \"ignoring the spirit of the law\", still be illegal. Of course, highly dependent on the country and lots of counter-examples. reply rs186 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Who are \"people\"? How would all of this start? In terms of standard, the specs already use \"ECMAScript\" and don't even mention JavaScript ( https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/ ), although TC39 website does use it frequently. I guess they could officially recommend people stop using \"JavaScript\", but I doubt they care. Otherwise, the petitioner Deno here is only a small part of the ecosystem and barely controls anything (and really nobody other than TC39 controls anything, which is good). They (or anyone else) can't just shout \"stop saying JavaScript!\" and expect people to follow. Not to mention JavaScript is a simple, easy to pronounce word compared to ECMAScript despite the baggage, which is probably why they chose it in the first place. Let's say the \"JavaScript\" name is officially deprecated somehow. People will continue to use the name for as long as it exists. So Deno's petition tackles these problems, addresses the root cause and appears to be legally viable. That is the \"right thing to do\" here. Avoiding the name does not solve the problem. It never does. reply falcor84 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] But everyone already calls it JS.

At some point they will approach companies, likely tech companies that produce a product or offering that can't be described without using the word \"JavaScript\". They will offer a \"convenient\" licensing agreement of $50,000 per year for the use of their trademark.
