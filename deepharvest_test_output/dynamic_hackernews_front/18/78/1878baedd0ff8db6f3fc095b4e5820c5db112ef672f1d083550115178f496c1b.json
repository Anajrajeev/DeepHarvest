Or not. Either way we imagined it to be hilarious. reply k_bx 2 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013] There's also Iggy https://github.com/apache/iggy Never tried it, but looks promising reply tormeh 34 minutes ago | parent | next [\u2013] Looks like it has a solid amount of contributors. Exciting! Some other attempts like Fluvio seem to have lost momentum. reply roncohen 2 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013] As someone who myself worked on a hobby-level Rust based Kafka alternative that used Raft for metadata coordination for ~8 months: nice work! Wasn't immediately clear to me if the data-plane level replication also happens through Raft or something home-rolled? Getting consistency and reliability right with something home-rolled is challenging. Notes: - Would love to see it in an S3-backed mode, either entirely diskless like WarpStream or as tiered storage. - Love the simplified API. If possible, adding a Kafka compatible API interface is probably worth it to connect to the broader ecosystem. Best of luck! reply nubskr 1 hour ago | parent | next [\u2013] Hi, the creator here, I think its a good idea to have S3 backed storage mode, its kinda tricky to do it for the 'active' block which we are currently writing to, but totally doable for historical data. Also about the kafka API, I tried to implement that earlier, I had a sort of `translation` layer for that earlier, but it gets pretty complicated to maintain that because kafka is offset based, while walrus is message based. reply EdwardDiego 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] TBH I don't think anyone can utilise S3 for the active segment, I didn't dig into Warpstream too much, but I vaguely recall they only offloaded to S3 once the segment was rolled. reply seanhunter 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013] It says on the github page \" It provides fault-tolerant streaming with automatic leadership rotation, segment-based partitioning, and Raft consensus for metadata coordination.\" So I guess that's a \"yes\" to raft? reply zbentley 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] GP asked about data plane consensus, not metadata/control plane. reply EdwardDiego 53 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013] They asked about data plane replication - e.g., leader -> followers. Unless I misunderstood them. reply teleforce 1 hour ago | prev | next [\u2013] For Kafka alternative written in C++ there's Redpanda [1],[2]. Redpanda claim of better performance but benchmarks showed no clear winner [3]. It will be interesting to test them together on the performance benchmarks. I've got the feeling it's not due to programming language implementation of Scala/Java (Kafka), C++ (Redpanda) and Rust (Walrus). It's the very architecture of Kafka itself due to the notorious head of line problem (check the top most comments [4].

Pushing gigabytes per second is not that difficult on modern hardware. Doing so with reasonable latency is what's challenging.
