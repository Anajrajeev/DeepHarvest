Web APIs CSS Custom Highlight API The CSS Custom Highlight API provides a mechanism for styling arbitrary text ranges on a document by using JavaScript to create the ranges, and CSS to style them. Web APIs Server timing Server-Timing is a part of the Performance API and allows servers to communicate metrics about the request-response cycle to the user agent. You can collect this information and act on server-side metrics in the same way as all the other metrics processed with the Performance API. JavaScript JavaScript resource management This guide talks about how to do resource management in JavaScript. Resource management is not exactly the same as memory management, which is a more advanced topic and usually handled automatically by JavaScript. Resource management is about managing resources that are not automatically cleaned up by JavaScript. Sometimes, it's okay to have some unused objects in memory, because they don't interfere with application logic, but resource leaks often lead to things not working, or a lot of excess memory usage. Therefore, this is not an optional feature about optimization, but a core feature to write correct programs!
