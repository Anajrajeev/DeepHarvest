URIs can be used to trigger behaviors other than fetching a resource, including opening an email client, sending text messages, or executing JavaScript, when used in other places such as the href of an HTML <a> link. In this article Reference Guides Specifications See also Reference The URI reference provides details about the components that make up a URI. Schemes The first part of the URI, before the : character, which indicates the protocol the browser must use to fetch the resource. Authority The section that comes after the scheme and before the path.\nIt may have up to three parts: user information, host , and port . Path The section after the authority.\nContains data, usually organized in hierarchical form, to identify a resource within the scope of the URI's scheme and authority. Fragment An optional part at the end of a URI starting with a # character.\nIt is used to identify a specific part of the resource, such as a section of a document or a position in a video. Guides The URI guides help you work with URIs on the web. Choosing between www and non-www URLs Guidance on when sites should use a www. prefix in URLs ( www.example.com vs example.com ).
