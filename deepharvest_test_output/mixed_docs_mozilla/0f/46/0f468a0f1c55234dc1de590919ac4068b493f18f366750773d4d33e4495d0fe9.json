This\nchapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript. You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to\ntake X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example,\nthe idea \"Go five steps to the east\" could be expressed this way as a loop: js for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {\n  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.\n  console.log(\"Walking east one step\");\n} There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing:\nthey repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could\nbe zero!) The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points\nof the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of\nloop over the others. The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are: for statement do...while statement while statement labeled statement break statement continue statement for...in statement for...of statement In this article for statement do...while statement while statement labeled statement break statement continue statement for...in statement for...of statement for statement A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop. A for statement looks as follows: js for (initialization; condition; afterthought)\n  statement When a for loop executes, the following occurs: The initializing expression initialization , if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables. The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop terminates. (If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.) The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ( { } ) to group those statements. If present, the update expression afterthought is executed. Control returns to Step 2. Example In the example below, the function contains a for statement that counts\nthe number of selected options in a scrolling list (a <select> element that allows multiple selections). HTML html <form name=\"selectForm\">\n  <label for=\"musicTypes\"\n    >Choose some music types, then click the button below:</label\n  >\n  <select id=\"musicTypes\" name=\"musicTypes\" multiple>\n    <option selected>R&amp;B</option>\n    <option>Jazz</option>\n    <option>Blues</option>\n    <option>New Age</option>\n    <option>Classical</option>\n    <option>Opera</option>\n  </select>\n  <button id=\"btn\" type=\"button\">How many are selected?</button>\n</form> JavaScript Here, the for statement declares the variable i and initializes it to 0 . It checks that i is less than the number of options in the <select> element, performs the succeeding if statement, and increments i by 1 after each pass through the loop. js function countSelected(selectObject) {\n  let numberSelected = 0;\n  for (let i = 0; i < selectObject.options.length; i++) {\n    if (selectObject.options[i].selected) {\n      numberSelected++;\n    }\n  }\n  return numberSelected;\n}\n\nconst btn = document.getElementById(\"btn\");\n\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  const musicTypes = document.selectForm.musicTypes;\n  console.log(`You have selected ${countSelected(musicTypes)} option(s).`);\n}); do...while statement The do...while statement repeats until a\nspecified condition evaluates to false. A do...while statement looks as follows: js do\n  statement\nwhile (condition); statement is always executed once before the condition is\nchecked. (To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ( { } )\nto group those statements.) If condition is true , the statement executes again. At the\nend of every execution, the condition is checked. When the condition is false , execution stops, and control passes to the statement following do...while . Example In the following example, the do loop iterates at least once and\nreiterates until i is no longer less than 5 . js let i = 0;\ndo {\n  i += 1;\n  console.log(i);\n} while (i < 5); while statement A while statement executes its statements as long as a\nspecified condition evaluates to true . A while statement looks\nas follows: js while (condition)\n  statement If the condition becomes false , statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the\nstatement following the loop. The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is\nexecuted. If the condition returns true , statement is executed\nand the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false , execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while . To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ( { } ) to group\nthose statements. Example 1 The following while loop iterates as long as n is\nless than 3 : js let n = 0;\nlet x = 0;\nwhile (n < 3) {\n  n++;\n  x += n;\n} With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x . Therefore, x and n take on the following\nvalues: After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1 After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3 After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6 After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true , so the loop terminates. Example 2 Avoid infinite loops. Make sure the condition in a loop eventually becomes false \u2014otherwise, the loop will never terminate! The statements in the\nfollowing while loop execute forever because the condition never becomes false : js // Infinite loops are bad!\nwhile (true) {\n  console.log(\"Hello, world!\");\n} labeled statement A label provides a statement with an identifier that\nlets you refer to it elsewhere in your program. For example, you can use a label to\nidentify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements\nto indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution. The syntax of the labeled statement looks like the following: js label:\n  statement The value of label may be any JavaScript identifier that is not a\nreserved word. The statement that you identify with a label may be\nany statement. For examples of using labeled statements, see the examples of break and continue below. break statement Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch , or in conjunction with a labeled statement. When you use break without a label, it terminates the innermost\nenclosing while , do-while , for , or switch immediately and transfers control to the following statement. When you use break with a label, it terminates the specified labeled\nstatement. The syntax of the break statement looks like this: js break;\nbreak label; The first form of the syntax terminates the innermost enclosing loop or switch . The second form of the syntax terminates the specified enclosing labeled statement. Example 1 The following example iterates through the elements in an array until it finds the\nindex of an element whose value is theValue : js for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n  if (a[i] === theValue) {\n    break;\n  }\n} Example 2: Breaking to a label js let x = 0;\nlet z = 0;\nlabelCancelLoops: while (true) {\n  console.log(\"Outer loops:\", x);\n  x += 1;\n  z = 1;\n  while (true) {\n    console.log(\"Inner loops:\", z);\n    z += 1;\n    if (z === 10 && x === 10) {\n      break labelCancelLoops;\n    } else if (z === 10) {\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n} continue statement The continue statement can be used to restart a while , do-while , for , or label statement. When you use continue without a label, it terminates the current\niteration of the innermost enclosing while , do-while , or for statement and continues execution of the loop with the next\niteration. In contrast to the break statement, continue does\nnot terminate the execution of the loop entirely. In a while loop, it\njumps back to the condition. In a for loop, it jumps to the increment-expression . When you use continue with a label, it applies to the looping statement\nidentified with that label. The syntax of the continue statement looks like the following: js continue;\ncontinue label; Example 1 The following example shows a while loop with a continue statement that executes when the value of i is 3 . Thus, n takes on the values 1 , 3 , 7 , and 12 . js let i = 0;\nlet n = 0;\nwhile (i < 5) {\n  i++;\n  if (i === 3) {\n    continue;\n  }\n  n += i;\n  console.log(n);\n}\n// Logs:\n// 1 3 7 12 If you comment out the continue; , the loop would run till the end and you would see 1,3,6,10,15 . Example 2 A statement labeled checkIandJ contains a statement labeled checkJ . If continue is encountered, the program\nterminates the current iteration of checkJ and begins the next\niteration. Each time continue is encountered, checkJ reiterates until its condition returns false . When false is\nreturned, the remainder of the checkIandJ statement is completed,\nand checkIandJ reiterates until its condition returns false . When false is returned, the program continues at the\nstatement following checkIandJ . If continue had a label of checkIandJ , the program\nwould continue at the top of the checkIandJ statement. js let i = 0;\nlet j = 10;\ncheckIandJ: while (i < 4) {\n  console.log(i);\n  i += 1;\n  checkJ: while (j > 4) {\n    console.log(j);\n    j -= 1;\n    if (j % 2 === 0) {\n      continue;\n    }\n    console.log(j, \"is odd.\");\n  }\n  console.log(\"i =\", i);\n  console.log(\"j =\", j);\n} for...in statement The for...in statement iterates a specified\nvariable over all the enumerable properties of an object. For each distinct property,\nJavaScript executes the specified statements. A for...in statement looks as\nfollows: js for (variable in object)\n  statement Example The following function takes as its argument an object and the object's name. It then\niterates over all the object's properties and returns a string that lists the property\nnames and their values. js function dumpProps(obj, objName) {\n  let result = \"\";\n  for (const i in obj) {\n    result += `${objName}.${i} = ${obj[i]}<br>`;\n  }\n  result += \"<hr>\";\n  return result;\n} For an object car with properties make and model , result would be: car.make = Ford\ncar.model = Mustang Arrays Although it may be tempting to use this as a way to iterate over Array elements, the for...in statement will return the name of your user-defined\nproperties in addition to the numeric indexes. Therefore, it is better to use a traditional for loop\nwith a numeric index when iterating over arrays, because the for...in statement iterates over user-defined properties in addition to the array elements, if\nyou modify the Array object (such as adding custom properties or methods). for...of statement The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating\nover iterable objects (including Array , Map , Set , arguments object and so on), invoking a custom\niteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property. js for (variable of iterable)\n  statement The following example shows the difference between a for...of loop and a for...in loop. While for...in iterates\nover property names, for...of iterates over property values: js const arr = [3, 5, 7];\narr.foo = \"hello\";\n\nfor (const i in arr) {\n  console.log(i);\n}\n// \"0\" \"1\" \"2\" \"foo\"\n\nfor (const i of arr) {\n  console.log(i);\n}\n// Logs: 3 5 7 The for...of and for...in statements can also be used with destructuring . For example, you can simultaneously loop over the keys and values of an object using Object.entries() . js const obj = { foo: 1, bar: 2 };\n\nfor (const [key, val] of Object.entries(obj)) {\n  console.log(key, val);\n}\n// \"foo\" 1\n// \"bar\" 2 Previous Next Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on \u2068Nov 3, 2025\u2069 by MDN contributors .

For examples of using labeled statements, see the examples of break and continue below. break statement Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch , or in conjunction with a labeled statement. When you use break without a label, it terminates the innermost\nenclosing while , do-while , for , or switch immediately and transfers control to the following statement. When you use break with a label, it terminates the specified labeled\nstatement. The syntax of the break statement looks like this: js break;\nbreak label; The first form of the syntax terminates the innermost enclosing loop or switch . The second form of the syntax terminates the specified enclosing labeled statement. Example 1 The following example iterates through the elements in an array until it finds the\nindex of an element whose value is theValue : js for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n  if (a[i] === theValue) {\n    break;\n  }\n} Example 2: Breaking to a label js let x = 0;\nlet z = 0;\nlabelCancelLoops: while (true) {\n  console.log(\"Outer loops:\", x);\n  x += 1;\n  z = 1;\n  while (true) {\n    console.log(\"Inner loops:\", z);\n    z += 1;\n    if (z === 10 && x === 10) {\n      break labelCancelLoops;\n    } else if (z === 10) {\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n} continue statement The continue statement can be used to restart a while , do-while , for , or label statement. When you use continue without a label, it terminates the current\niteration of the innermost enclosing while , do-while , or for statement and continues execution of the loop with the next\niteration. In contrast to the break statement, continue does\nnot terminate the execution of the loop entirely. In a while loop, it\njumps back to the condition. In a for loop, it jumps to the increment-expression . When you use continue with a label, it applies to the looping statement\nidentified with that label. The syntax of the continue statement looks like the following: js continue;\ncontinue label; Example 1 The following example shows a while loop with a continue statement that executes when the value of i is 3 . Thus, n takes on the values 1 , 3 , 7 , and 12 . js let i = 0;\nlet n = 0;\nwhile (i < 5) {\n  i++;\n  if (i === 3) {\n    continue;\n  }\n  n += i;\n  console.log(n);\n}\n// Logs:\n// 1 3 7 12 If you comment out the continue; , the loop would run till the end and you would see 1,3,6,10,15 . Example 2 A statement labeled checkIandJ contains a statement labeled checkJ . If continue is encountered, the program\nterminates the current iteration of checkJ and begins the next\niteration. Each time continue is encountered, checkJ reiterates until its condition returns false . When false is\nreturned, the remainder of the checkIandJ statement is completed,\nand checkIandJ reiterates until its condition returns false . When false is returned, the program continues at the\nstatement following checkIandJ . If continue had a label of checkIandJ , the program\nwould continue at the top of the checkIandJ statement. js let i = 0;\nlet j = 10;\ncheckIandJ: while (i < 4) {\n  console.log(i);\n  i += 1;\n  checkJ: while (j > 4) {\n    console.log(j);\n    j -= 1;\n    if (j % 2 === 0) {\n      continue;\n    }\n    console.log(j, \"is odd.\");\n  }\n  console.log(\"i =\", i);\n  console.log(\"j =\", j);\n} for...in statement The for...in statement iterates a specified\nvariable over all the enumerable properties of an object. For each distinct property,\nJavaScript executes the specified statements. A for...in statement looks as\nfollows: js for (variable in object)\n  statement Example The following function takes as its argument an object and the object's name. It then\niterates over all the object's properties and returns a string that lists the property\nnames and their values. js function dumpProps(obj, objName) {\n  let result = \"\";\n  for (const i in obj) {\n    result += `${objName}.${i} = ${obj[i]}<br>`;\n  }\n  result += \"<hr>\";\n  return result;\n} For an object car with properties make and model , result would be: car.make = Ford\ncar.model = Mustang Arrays Although it may be tempting to use this as a way to iterate over Array elements, the for...in statement will return the name of your user-defined\nproperties in addition to the numeric indexes. Therefore, it is better to use a traditional for loop\nwith a numeric index when iterating over arrays, because the for...in statement iterates over user-defined properties in addition to the array elements, if\nyou modify the Array object (such as adding custom properties or methods). for...of statement The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating\nover iterable objects (including Array , Map , Set , arguments object and so on), invoking a custom\niteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property. js for (variable of iterable)\n  statement The following example shows the difference between a for...of loop and a for...in loop. While for...in iterates\nover property names, for...of iterates over property values: js const arr = [3, 5, 7];\narr.foo = \"hello\";\n\nfor (const i in arr) {\n  console.log(i);\n}\n// \"0\" \"1\" \"2\" \"foo\"\n\nfor (const i of arr) {\n  console.log(i);\n}\n// Logs: 3 5 7 The for...of and for...in statements can also be used with destructuring . For example, you can simultaneously loop over the keys and values of an object using Object.entries() . js const obj = { foo: 1, bar: 2 };\n\nfor (const [key, val] of Object.entries(obj)) {\n  console.log(key, val);\n}\n// \"foo\" 1\n// \"bar\" 2 Previous Next Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on \u2068Nov 3, 2025\u2069 by MDN contributors .
