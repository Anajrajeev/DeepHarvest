To take full advantage of these technologies, you need to know how to use them. Below you'll find links to our Web technology documentation. In this article Documentation for Web developers Web technology references Developer tools documentation Documentation for Web developers Web developer guides The Web Developer Guides provide practical, how-to content to help you use Web technologies for your goals or needs. Tutorials for Web developers Tutorials to take you step-by-step through learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs. Accessibility Enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way. Performance Making content as available and interactive as possible, as soon as possible. Privacy Protecting users' personal data. Security Protecting users from data leaks and data theft, side-channel attacks, and attacks such as cross-site scripting, content injection, and click-jacking. Glossary Definitions of Web-related terms. Web technology references Web APIs JavaScript programming APIs you can use to build apps on the Web. HTML HTML provides the fundamental building blocks for structuring Web documents and apps. CSS Cascading Style Sheets are used to describe the appearance of Web documents and apps. JavaScript JavaScript is the Web's native programming language. WebAssembly WebAssembly allows programs written in C, C++, Rust, Swift, C#, Go, and more to run on the Web. HTTP HTTP is the fundamental Internet protocol for fetching documents, stylesheets, scripts, images, videos, fonts, and other resources over the Web \u2014 and for sending data back to Web servers. Media Formats, codecs, protocols, APIs, and techniques for embedding and streaming video, audio, and image content in Web documents and apps. SVG Scalable Vector Graphics lets you create images that scale smoothly to any size. MathML MathML lets you display complex mathematical notation on the Web. URI Uniform Resource Identifiers are used by various technologies, including the browser itself via the address bar, to identify resources in various ways. WebDriver WebDriver is a browser-automation mechanism for remotely controlling a browser by emulating the actions of a real person using the browser. It's widely used for cross-browser testing of Web apps. Web Extensions Web Extensions are a way for you to give users enhanced capabilities in their browsers \u2014 for doing things such as blocking ads and other content, customizing the appearance of pages, and more. Web App Manifests Web App Manifests let you enable users to install Web apps to their device home screens, with aspects such as portrait/landscape screen orientation and display mode (e.g., full screen) pre-set. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) Progressive Web Apps provide a user experience similar to native mobile apps. OpenSearch OpenSearch allows a website to describe a search engine for itself, so that a browser or other client application can use that search engine. XML The Extensible Markup Language is a strict serialization of the Document Object Model . XSLT Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations is an XML -based language used, in conjunction with specialized processing software, for the transformation of XML documents. XPath XPath uses a non-XML syntax to provide a flexible way of addressing (pointing to) different parts of an XML document. It can also be used to test addressed nodes within a document to determine whether they match a pattern or not. EXSLT EXSLT a set of extensions to XSLT .
