MDN provides you with extended HTML reference documentation as well as a deep instructional set of HTML guides . However, in many cases we just need some quick hints as we go. That's the whole purpose of the cheat sheet, to give you some quick accurate ready to use code snippets for common usages. Note: HTML tags must be used for their semantic value, not their appearance. It's always possible to totally change the look and feel of a given tag using CSS so, when using HTML, take the time to focus on the meaning rather than the appearance. In this article Inline elements Block elements Inline elements An \"element\" is a single part of a webpage. Some elements are large and hold smaller elements like containers. Some elements are small and are \"nested\" inside larger ones. By default, \"inline elements\" appear next to one another in a webpage. They take up only as much width as they need in a page and fit together horizontally like words in a sentence or books shelved side-by-side in a row. All inline elements can be placed within the <body> element. Inline elements: usage and examples Usage Element Example A link <a> html <a href=\"https://example.org\">\nA link to example.org</a>. An image <img> html <img src=\"beast.png\" width=\"50\" /> An inline container <span> html Used to group elements: for example,\nto <span style=\"color:blue\">style\nthem</span>. Emphasize text <em> html <em>I'm posh</em>. Italic text <i> html Mark a phrase in <i>italics</i>. Bold text <b> html Bold <b>a word or phrase</b>. Important text <strong> html <strong>I'm important!</strong> Highlight text <mark> html <mark>Notice me!</mark> Strikethrough text <s> html <s>I'm irrelevant.</s> Subscript <sub> html H<sub>2</sub>O Small text <small> html Used to represent the <small>small\nprint </small>of a document.

They also take up a full line of a webpage; they do not fit together side-by-side. Instead, they stack like paragraphs in an essay or toy blocks in a tower. Note: Because this cheat sheet is limited to a few elements representing specific structures or having special semantics, the div element is intentionally not included \u2014 because the div element doesn't represent anything and doesn't have any special semantics.
